# Heart-Stroke-Predictor

An ensemble machine learning model which can detect whether a patient is at risk of having a stroke using their medical information.

The medical information of more than 600 individuals is analysed. The dataset requires some pre-processing and a few requirements that must be taken into consideration when preparing the data are as follows:

Only features which are well known to contribute to the risk of a stroke need to be taken.
There is a need to convert some of the numerical feature variables into categorical ones.

Here a good solution would be to predict (with reasonable accuracy) whether or not a new patient (i.e., one that is not in the dataset) was at high risk of a stroke. It is also important that the solution performs well for both well and at-risk persons.
